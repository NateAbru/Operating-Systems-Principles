Contiguous Memory Allocation

1) Do only the Best Fit Strategy. 
2) Please provide output as shown in the sample format below.  
    allocator>STAT 
    Addresses [0 : 315000] Process P1 
    Addresses [315001 : 512500] Process P3 
    Addresses [512501 : 625575] Free 
    Addresses [625575 : 725100] Process P6 
    Addresses [725001 : END ]  Free 
3) You must run the following script of RQ, RL, C, STAT commands  as test input on your own computer    
and submit the output  of execution of the 4 STAT commands. The memory size as input is 1 MB (1048576).    
Remember that Compaction moves processes towards the low end of addresses and free space to the high     
end of memory addresses. Memory addresses start at 0.
